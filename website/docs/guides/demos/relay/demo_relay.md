# InSim Relay

This demo showcases using the `InSim Relay` to show a list of hosts and connect to one.

![Relay host list](./relay.jpg)

## Prerequisites

This demo does not need LFS to be running.

## The demo

Upon start, the relay will connect automatically and display a list of available hosts. Note that
the relay is opt-in for hosts, so there will likely be less hosts than the in-game list.

When you click a host, the list of connected players will be displayed on the right.
