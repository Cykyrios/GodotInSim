# Godot InSim Demos

Each directory contains a demo scene showcasing some of GodotInSim's capabilities.
Each demo comes with its own readme file explaining the showcased features as well as
any specific project settings that should be enabled (if they cannot be enabled at runtime
by the demo itself).
